## Boot2Root

A CTF challenge where you need to find ways to become root.

### Setup

<ins>Tools:</ins>
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-platforms)

First, we need to download the tools required, listed above, for this project.\
Once, everything is downloaded, we can then setup each virtual machines, individually.

#### VirtualBox Setup
We need to create 2 separate virtual machines:
- One that hosts the server we need to attack
- A second one that will run with Kali Linux

After creating both VMs, we have to setup a virtual network so they can communicate together. To proceed, we'll go into File > Tools > Network Manager.

Next, create a network if there's none present.

Finally, enable the DHCP server if it's not enabled.

And now, we have a virtual network!

To finish the setup, we need to set our VMs on the freshly created virtual network. For each machines, go into Settings > Network.

Then, set *attached to:* on Host-only Adapter and select the virtual network we just created.

And *Voil√†*! The virtual network is ready!
